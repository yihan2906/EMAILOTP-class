Assumptions:
- We assume no variations or subdomains are accepted (e.g., test@dso.org.sg.com is not accepted).
- No database implementation is required for attempt logs or storing generated OTPs; everything is handled in memory.
- We assume that the send_email function manages the email delivery and all the retry logic. (another SMTP/IMAP module that interacts with our class.)

Testing:
- Writing some common unit tests.
- Perform some manual integration tests for the class functions.
